## 2. Analyzing Monthly Costs of Existing Applications

Azure tags provide a powerful way to organize and manage resources. By tagging resources with relevant information, such as the environment, application name, owner, and project, we can filter cost management data to analyze the expenses related to specific parts of our infrastructure. This exercise aims to demonstrate how to use these tags to calculate and analyze the monthly cost of a specified application.

Northwind's pizza has two applications: the PizzaOrderPortal, which hosts Northwind's main website, and DoughDynasty, which manages the recipe database and ingredient supply chain. The PizzaOrderPortal is a production resource managed by the PizzaOpsTeam, ensuring seamless customer orders and deliveries. DoughDynasty, on the other hand, is still in development, managed by the DoughDevelopers team, focusing on perfecting the art of pizza dough and ingredient optimization.

**Exercise:**
In the cost management portal, identify the monthly cost of both applications, PizzaOrderPortal and DoughDynasty, and also calculate the total cost of the GourmetRollout project. By breaking down these costs, you will gain insights into which areas consume the most resources and can make informed decisions to optimize expenditure.

Note: If there isn't enough data to see the monthly cost, take the daily cost and multiply it by 30 to estimate the monthly expense.

## 3. Identifying Idle Resources

As Northwind's pizza business flourished, its cloud infrastructure expanded faster than dough in the summer sun to meet growing customer demands and ensure seamless operations.However, amongst this rapid growth, the PizzaOpsTeam overlooked regular maintenance and cleanup of the environment. This oversight allowed unused resources to accumulate, leading to unnecessary costs and operational inefficiencies.

Picture a storeroom filled with outdated ingredients and unused kitchen gadgetsâ€”items that were once vital but now gather dust. Similarly, Northwind's cloud environment became cluttered with idle virtual machines, unattached disks, and forgotten public IP addresses. This oversight started to weigh on the company's operational costs, diverting funds away from potential new features and innovations.

Note: Do note delete these resources now as they will be used in the next exercise.

**Exercise:**
Azure Advisor offers a Cost Optimization workbook specifically designed to identify unused resources. Your task is to use this workbook to review Northwind's cloud environment and identify production resources that are idle.

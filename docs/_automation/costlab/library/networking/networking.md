# Azure Firewall 

## Query: Azure Firewall and Firewall Policies Analysis

This Azure Resource Graph (ARG) query analyzes Azure Firewalls and their associated Firewall Policies within your Azure environment. It focuses on Firewalls with a Premium SKU tier and checks for specific configurations in their associated Firewall Policies.

## Description

This query identifies Azure Firewalls with a Premium SKU tier and examines their associated Firewall Policies. It specifically looks for Firewalls where intrusion detection is not configured to alert or deny actions, and where transport security does not utilize Key Vault secret IDs.

### Category

Optimization

### Potential Benefits

- **Cost Optimization:** Identifies Firewall with Premium SKU that are not using premium features. If these premium features are not needed, this firewall can moved to a standard tier.

## Query: Azure Firewall and Associated Subnets Analysis

This Azure Resource Graph (ARG) query analyzes Azure Firewalls and their associated subnets within your Azure environment. It provides insights into which subnets are associated with each Azure Firewall instance.

### Description
This query identifies Azure Firewalls and their associated subnets in your Azure environment. It links each firewall to its corresponding subnet based on subnet IDs containing 'AzureFirewallSubnet'.

### Category

Optimization

### Potential Benefits
 - **Cost Optimization:** Optimize the use of Azure Firewall by having a central instance of Azure Firewall in the hub virtual network or Virtual WAN secure hub and share the same firewall across many spoke virtual networks that are connected to the same hub from the same region. Ensure there's no unexpected cross-region traffic as part of the hub-spoke topology nor multiple Azure firewall instances deployed to the same region.
